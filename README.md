# 🎓 Campus Predictive Analytics Chatbot

## 📌 Problem Statement
Campuses often face challenges in:
- Identifying at-risk students early for timely interventions.
- Predicting equipment failures (HVAC, utilities) before breakdowns.
- Planning resources efficiently for custodial/maintenance needs.
- Forecasting attendance and managing logistics for campus events.

These issues lead to inefficiencies, reduced student support, and high maintenance costs.
